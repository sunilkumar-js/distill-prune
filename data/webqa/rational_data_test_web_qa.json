The embargo was further tightened on February 3, 1962, when the United States prohibited all imports of Cuban products into the United States and banned all American travel to Cuba.\n\nThe embargo was a response to several factors. One of the primary reasons was Fidel Castro's takeover of the Cuban government in 1959. Castro was a Marxist revolutionary who came to power after a long and bloody struggle against the U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista. The United States saw Castro as a threat to its interests in the Western Hemisphere and feared that he would align Cuba with the Soviet Union.\n\nAnother reason for the embargo was the nationalization of American-owned properties in Cuba. After Castro came to power, he nationalized U.S.-owned sugar plantations, oil refineries, and other businesses without compensation. This was a major blow to U.S. businesses and led to a significant loss of American investment in Cuba.\n\nThe embargo was also a response to Cuba's close relationship with the Soviet Union. In 1960, the Soviet Union signed a deal to provide Cuba with sugar and oil in exchange for the use of Cuban ports for Soviet naval vessels. This was seen as a threat to U.S. security and led to the imposition of the embargo.\n\nAnswer: The embargo against Cuba was imposed by the United States in response to Fidel Castro's takeover of the Cuban government in 1959, the nationalization of American-owned properties in Cuba, and Cuba's close relationship with the Soviet Union."}, {"question": "what is the name of the capital of belgium?", "answers": ["City of Brussels"], "rational": "--------------------------------\nRational: To find the capital city of Belgium, we need to use our prior knowledge or look it up in a reliable source.\nAnswer: Brussels"}, {"question": "what kind of government does japan have now?", "answers": ["Parliamentary system", "Unitary state", "Constitutional monarchy"], "rational": "\nRational: Japan is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system.
